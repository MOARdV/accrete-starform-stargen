# ACCRETE (C)

Nyrath, like the others, has a cached copy of what I assume is one of the first gen iterations of Burdick's accrete 
program. Gen 2/3 being starform. This version is dated as been last modified later than Burrell's copy, so we have a 
potential version order between them.

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

## Features

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)


## Limitations:

see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

### In Recreation:
- Source Code is complete.

- Nyrath? made changes to the display code to output the generated system to a file

- Earth's albedo is changed from 0.3 to 0.39

## Compilation
Source Code is written in C. As is, it may need modifications to run on modern systems. It has a makefile, but the 
compiler may need to be persuaded as to what PI is. A switch was made to output the data as a file, rather than on 
console.

latest accrete code
