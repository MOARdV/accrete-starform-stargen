# Accrete (C)

A version cached by Peter Keel on his traveller rpg site. It's pretty similar to Nyrath's, with some minor 
modifications.

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

## Features

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)


## Limitations:

see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

### In Recreation:
- Source Code is complete.

- There are no significant changes from Nyrath's copy

- see [here](/docs/notes/build descriptions/1990s/1995%20-%20Nyrath.1995.md) for notes on Nyrath's changes.

- VERBOSE logging of events is off by default.

- PI is set to M_PI

- includes a 1997 copy of Torben AE. Mogensen planetary map generator, the latest version of it can be
  found [here](http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~torbenm/Planet/)

## Compilation
Source Code is written in C. As is, it may need modifications to run on modern systems. It currently compiles for me via
makefile, but the compiler may need to be persuaded as to what PI is. 

see [here](/docs/notes/branches%20&%20forks%20&%20stubs/pre-github/burdick%20-%20accrete%20-%203.x%20-%20starform.md) for 
the status on Burdick's latest accrete code
