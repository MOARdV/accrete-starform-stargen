# Accrete2 (C)

A version based on Andrew Folkins, hacked about by Keris, removing some of his optimisations and added gas accretion for
normal planets to give some sort of atmosphere, it seems to work reasonably. The output formats are (of course) totally
different from starform.

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

## Features
- Generates a variety of primary stars, based on probability tables provided to Folkins by John Carr in 1988.

- Change from straight firing in planetesimals at random, to only doing that for the first 20 or so, then adds the rest
  around the remaining dust bands

- Adds in functions from Fogg's paper

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

## Limitations:

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

### In Recreation:
- Source Code is complete.

## Compilation
Compiles with make

code.
