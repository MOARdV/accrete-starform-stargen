# ACCRETE (C)

Mat Burdick's simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers. The main fork of source code that everyone
seems to of worked off.

This looks like the same major version as the incomplete code gilham supplied so it should make for an interesting
comparison.

Only differences are seemingly indentation.

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

## Features

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)


## Limitations:

see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

### In Recreation:
- No way to easily recreate exact tests results without the original random number generator

- No recreation of Fogg's atmosphere gating

- Source Code is complete.

## Compilation
Source Code is written in C. As is, it needs modifications to run on modern systems.

latest accrete code
