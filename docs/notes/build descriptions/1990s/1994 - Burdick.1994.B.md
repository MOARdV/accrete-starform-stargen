# Starform (C)

Mat Burdick's third iteration of his simulation reversed engineered from Dole and Fogg's papers.

Like the other iterations this seems to be the main fork of source code that everyone seems to of worked off. Unfortunately I was unable
to detect a site belonging to him that still hosted his source code so third party hosted copies will have to do.

Accrete2 and Starform are names given to this iteration fairly interchangeably.

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Previous's Versions](/docs/notes/build descriptions/1990s/1994%20-%20Burdick.1994.A.md)

## Features

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

- Some Moon generation code.

- constants' value tweaks

- lisp style cmd output

- better usage options

## Limitations:

see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

### In Recreation:
- No way to easily recreate exact tests results without the original random number generator

- No recreation of Fogg's atmosphere gating

- Source Code is complete.

## Compilation
Source Code is written in C.
