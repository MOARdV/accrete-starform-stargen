# Acrete (basic)

This is Steve Gilham's first iteration, published in White Dwarf back in 1984. 

I have ran the article through a web ocr utility, but abandoned cleaning that up until I have more time. 

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Dole's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1969%20-%20Formation%20of%20Planetary%20Systems%20by%20Aggregation.md)

## Features
- Generates a variety of primary stars, based on some probability of their occurrence and bounded by the max and minimum
  mass that was estimated to potentially harbour planets in a stable system at the time..

- see [notes on Dole's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1969%20-%20Formation%20of%20Planetary%20Systems%20by%20Aggregation.md)


## Limitations:

see [notes on Dole's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1969%20-%20Formation%20of%20Planetary%20Systems%20by%20Aggregation.md)

### In Recreation:
- No way to easily recreate exact tests results without the original random number generator

- Basic is not an easily language to understand when coming from a more modern background

### With the Model:
- No Attempt was made to alter the dust cloud calculations for non 1 solar mass stars.

## Compilation
Its written in ibm basic which I could not even begin to guess how to compile. Given later code is more interesting,
any such attempts are on the backburner.
