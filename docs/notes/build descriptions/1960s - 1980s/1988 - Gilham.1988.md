# Accrete (C)

This is the first, albeit incomplete, iteration of Matt Burdick's C code, republished by Steve Gilham on Usenet 
in 1993. This technical predates the definitely older pascal code because of the time stamps on the files that Ian 
Burrell has. In any case, this was written at some point between '93 and '88. 


Unfortunately the shar he published was cutoff / partly recorded by Google groups.

As such we only have two complete files from this publication, "accrete.c" and "display.c", as well as an incomplete 
"enviro.c".  

## Basic Assumptions:

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

## Features

- see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)


## Limitations:

see [notes on Fogg's paper](/docs/notes/build%20descriptions/1960s%20-%201980s/1985%20-%20Extra-Solar%20Planetary%20Systems.md)

### In Recreation:
- No way to easily recreate exact tests results without the original random number generator

- No recreation of Fogg's atmosphere gating

- Source Code is unfortunately incomplete.

## Compilation
Source Code is unfortunately incomplete.

latest accrete code
