Jon Leech ported code to C++ based on code written by Wales Larrison. He mentions an ftp site where his code is located, ftp.cs.unc.edu:pub/acrete.c, but it 
is no longer stored there. 
 
I have acquired a version of it from Ian Burrell's [website](http://znark.com/create/accrete.html), though I do not know if there have been any changes in 
the meantime.
