Andrew Folkins at some point published a version of accrete for the amiga.

Unfortunately it was packed up in a shar which has a different last modified date than the wrapping header info, so I am 
uncertain about this version's exact date.

Like Steve Gilham, his line of code is at least initially distinct from Burdick's.

### [Accrete2](https://web.archive.org/web/20040905132355/http://firedrake.org/keris/stars/index.html)

- Burdick Version: n/a
- Key: Keris.1999

A version based on Andrew Folkins, hacked about by Keris, removing some of his optimisations and added gas accretion for 
normal planets to give some sort of atmosphere, it seems to work reasonably. The output formats are (of course) totally 
different from starform.
