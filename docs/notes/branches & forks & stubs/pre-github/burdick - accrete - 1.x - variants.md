Erik Max Francis produced a slightly modified version of Burdick's code that prints it's output slightly differently. It 
seems to extends from the first generation code line.

I am unsure as to which of Burdick.1994.A and Nyrath.1995 is the closest to being the actual parent. However I have a 
strong opinion that it extends from Nyrath's original source.
