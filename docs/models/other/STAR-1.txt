                        STAR    v1.3
                        ************


Introduction:

   Star is a system generator for SF GMs.It's like Accrete,a little
less science oriented (no exact formulas but datas still are
realistics).It's based on Accrete (a cool program) and RPG planet
generators (principally 2300AD,Space Opera,Legion of Super Heroes
vol II,World Builder's Handbook).I think Star is more complete than
other identic stuffs (like Accrete for example) cause it includes
things like binary sytems,asteroids,atmospheric compostion,
unusual planet characteristics (rings,native life,high tides...),
day and night temperatures or quantity of mineral ressources.
It's not the final version and with time new features will be added.
When generating systems Star creates a text file with all the 
information: star.log (or star.??? if you used the command option
/x???).
 
History:
  v1.0 :the original release
  v1.1 :added three new unusual characteristics (unstable planets,high
        humidity,low humidity),fixed two bugs (effective luminosity of
        two stars and the width of asteroid belt) and changed the
        determination of unusual characteristics.
  v1.2 :added gaia parameter and alien generator.    
  v1.21:fixed a bug in luminosity calcul.
  v1.3 :added new descriptions for moons,filename extension for the log
        file,alien descriptions are now in the same file as the system
        log file,mineral resources are divided in 5 different categories,
        four new alien government types.
  v1.4 :used objects programming (mainly for future addons),fixed a bug       
        on star creation (stars with no spectral class).

Some precisions:

a) World types:

  -Rock:a plain rock ball with no appreciable atmosphere.
  -Ice Ball:a plain ball of frozen gases.
  -Gas Giant:a massive planet with an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.
  -Hot House:a planet with a large greenhouse-effect atmosphere.
  -Glacier:a planet with a heavy overburden of ice.
  -Desert:a planet with an atmosphere but without liquid water.(Example:Mars)
  -Failed Core:a planet which accumulated an atmosphere but which never 
   accumulated enough mass to become a gas giant.(Example:Triton)
  -Terran:a world with a hospitable environment and an oxygen atmosphere.
   (Example:Earth)
  -Arid:a world with a hospitable environment but with less than 20% of 
   liquid water.(Example:Dune)
  -Jungle:a world with a hospitable environment entierly covered by jungles 
   and swamps.
  -Ocean:a world with a hospitable environment with more than 90 % of liquid 
   water.
  -Steppe:a world with a hospitable environment and between 30 and 50 % of 
   liquid water.
  -Chunk:a small airless world less than 1000 km in diameter.

b) Unusual Characteristics

  -Extreme Vulcanism:the planetary crust is unstable either because the
   planet is still young or due to a gravitational factor like an oversize
   moon.
  -Atmospheric Contaminants:the atmosphere is polluted with various gases
   or dust.
  -Meteors Storms:the planet suffers frequent meteor storms, often including
   large asteroid or comet impacts, making the planet's surface a dangerous
   place.
  -High Radiation Level:this world has a radiation level much higher than
   Earth-normal.This could be due to several factors:a thin atmosphere,
   radioactive minerals or a nuclear war.
  -Violent Storms:this could be dust or sand storms on arid or desert planets,
   a frontal activity between well defined climate belts ...
  -Microbes:unusual micro-organisms are present in the atmosphere.This could
   cause several different results,the most common is the presence of
   diseases.
  -Orbital Conjunction:a body in the system passes close enough to the world
   to cause any one of a number of effects (extreme vulcanism,tidal waves ...)
   Such a conjunction would happen rarely,occuring only once in a matter or
   decades or even centuries.
  -Rugged Terrain:the planet's land surface is almost entirely covered with
   mountains and rough, rocky terrain, with practically no flat plains or
   rounded hills.
  -Retrograde Rotation:like Venus the rotation  is in a retrograde movement.
  -Unstable Climate:the climate undergoes severe and unpredictable changes
   from year to year.
  -Orbital Eccentricity:the planet has an erratic orbit,such a world would
   combine the result of extreme axial tilt and extreme vulcanism with extreme
   variation in temperature.
  -Strong Magnetic Field:this world has a strong magnetic field,an effect
   that can have consequences in the biological makeup of the natives.
  -Cloud Cover:the planet has a permanent cloud cover over its entire surface;
   it probably rains most of the time.
  -No Axial Tilt:the world's axis is perpendicular to the plane of ecliptic.
   Therefore,there are no seasonal weather changes.
  -High Tides:a large, close moon or sun produces extremely high tides.
  -Tidal Lock:the world's period of revolution about its primary coincides
   exactly with its period of rotation on its axis;that is,its year is the
   same length as the day.The consequence is that one side of the world will
   always be turned toward the sun.
  -Extreme Axial Tilt:the planet's axis is tilted closer to the plane of the
   ecliptic than Earth's.There will be extreme variation in seasons,with
   bitter cold temperatures in winter and searing heat in summer.
  -Native Intelligent Lifeforms:the planet has a native sentient life form,
   which may or may not have advanced technology.
  -Native Semi-Intelligent Lifeforms:the planet has a native life form which
   is not fully sentient yet, but comes close, and may develop further.
  -Unstable Planet:the planet is fatally unstable and it might be in danger
   of blowing up in the forseable future.
  -High Humidity:(only for worlds with water)high humidity at high 
   temperatures can prove to be uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous,it's 
   like living in a steam bath.
  -Low Humidity:(only for world with water) at high temperatures will cause
   rapid drying of mucus membranes,dehydration and eventually delirium.


c) Stars & systems:
  I only included six spectral types:A,F,G,K,M and white dwarfs because type
  O and B stars are extremely rare.Like in 2300AD I assumed that A stars and
  white dwarfs didn't have allowed orbits.

d) Mineral ressources:planet's mineral resources are measured on an
  arbitrary scale, running from 1 (very rare) to 100 (huge quantities).
  For comparison, Earth values are:
      Metal ore      : 50
      Radioactive ore: 20
      Precious metal : 5
      Raw crystals   : 15
      Precious gems  : 5

      

e) Temperature:
     -Effects of eccentricity:the eccentricity of the orbit will cause higher
      temperatures at closest approach and lower temperatures at the farthest
      separation from the star.
     -Maximum increase:the maximum increase in temperature during the summer.
     -Maximum decrease:the maximum decrease in temperature during the winter.
     -Maximum day increase:the average temperature increase during the day.
     -Maximum day decrease:the average temperature decrease during the night.

f) Satellites:
     The orbit is the orbit radius of the satellite in thousand of kilometres,
     mine is the quantity of mineral ressources.

g) Gaia parameter
     A user of Star send me a request on how to have more often Terran worlds.
     So I decided to include a Gaia parameter who increase the chance of 
     having Terran planets.Normally there are between 5 and 10 % of chance
     to have habitable worlds,when you use the gaia parameter you increase
     the chance to between 40 and 50 %.
     For using gaia parameter type :
       star /g

h) Alien generator
     The alien generator program (alien.exe) can be used separetly of star
     generator.

i) Future addons :
  There are projects of addons in the near future:
   -more unusual characteristics
   -more spectral types (type O,B ,Size I and IV,brown dwarfs ...)
   -corrosive and insidious atmospheres
   -trinary systems
   -a better documentation
