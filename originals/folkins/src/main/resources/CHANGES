		  CHANGE LOG (latest at start of file)

Changed type of PlanetList (container of planets and moons) to
vector<Planet> rather than list<Planet> to allow random-access (which is
a pretty sensible thing to expect when looking at a solar system, let's
face it; I only used a list<> before because the original code was
written using lists).  dole.cc now has an internal list of the system
it's building, because that /does/ need lists rather than vectors to
work.

Still no overall classes, but it's getting there...
