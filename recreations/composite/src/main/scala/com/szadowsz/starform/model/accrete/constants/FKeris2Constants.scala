//  * Croughton's code that follows Folkins' code line uses identical constants to the stock Dole ones.
//  *
//  * Only Difference is that in some instances in his original code he converts the unit that the constants are stored in to International System of Units(SI)
//  * units, rather than Solar Units.
//  *
//  * I have opted for making the unit of measurements the same as Dole's during the computation and adding a toggle during display, to avoid confusion when
//  * debugging.
