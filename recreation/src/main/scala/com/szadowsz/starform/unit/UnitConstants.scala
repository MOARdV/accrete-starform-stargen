  * Constants File inherits the fully fledged unit categories and declares constants that don't quite fit into them.

  *  These values should not be alterable.

  * These values come from the following files of the original programs unless otherwise noted:
  * const.h - Burdick (accrete)
  * const.h - Burdick (starform)
  * const.h - Keris (starform)
  * const.h - Webb (starform)
  * PhysicalConstants.java - Burke (starform)

  * Folkins and Gilham do not have a separation between constants and calculation, therefore you will find their declarations in the same place as the
  * functions that use them.
